The Wisconsin Vintage Car Show is an exhibition of many American and Foreign old school rides, from muscle cars down to the more quirky of the lot. Come down to Spring Green to see it all, from the fastest rides to the loudest engines. Food and drink are both provided and welcome for this all-day event, with a few musical performances to help lighten the mood and provide some all-needed ambiance. Look out for the coming summer, as the Plymouth and mustangs signal the next Vintage Carfest coming to a small Wisconsin town near you!
